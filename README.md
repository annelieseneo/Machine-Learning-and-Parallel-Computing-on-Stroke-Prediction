# Machine Learning and Parallel Computing on Stroke Prediction

Learning Outcome : To demonstrate skills to solve practical problems in machine learning and parallel computing.

Task Highlights :

* Available data types in this data set.

* Noises, anomalies, and outliers.

* Attribute dependencies.

* Logical relationship between the attributes.

* Other dataset manual observation.

* Apply pre-processing techniques using Python programing language. 

* Use and modify a piece of program in Python and create a prediction model to predict heart stroke for any new record of data. 

* Create a model to predict level of Glucose using the given data (The last column from the dataset can be removed if itâ€™s needed). 

* Evaluate the prediction models.
